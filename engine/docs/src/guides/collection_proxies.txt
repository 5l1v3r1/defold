Collection Proxies
==================

Defold organizes all game objects in collections. A collection can contain game objects and other collections (i.e. sub-collections). When Defold starts up it loads, initiates and enables a top level collection as defined in the project settings (see link:/doc/game_project[Project settings]). Most templates have a preset "main.collection" that loads at startup.

For many projects, containing the whole app in the top level collection is sufficient, but there are several cases (see below) where you will need a more powerful means of organizing your project: dynamically loading and unloading top level collections within your project.

Collection proxies act as an outlet that serves on behalf of a collection file—you can communicate with a collection file that is not yet loaded by proxy.  You can tell it to load, initialize, enable, disable, finalize and unload.

All communication with collection proxies regarding loading and unloading is done asynchronously: however, the actual loading and unloading is not implemented as a background process, so the engine will briefly pause when the actual loading and unloading happens.

== Typical use cases

Many games are separated into separate levels that are played one after the other. If your level content is manually built in the editor you will end up with a group of collections, each with a level inside (consisting of tilemaps, sprites etc). Collection proxies allow you to do this separation of content and then dynamically manage them through scripting.

Possible uses of collection proxies are:

* Loading/unloading of game levels.
* Loading/unloading of front end GUI.
* Loading/unloading of narrative "scenes" throughout a level.
* Loading/unloading of mini-games.
* Loading/unloading of user selected content (music, background images etc)

[NOTE]
Loading/unloading ("streaming") of regions in a seamless large world is possible to implement with collection proxies, but know that the actual loading is synchronous so you would want to keep the world pieces small and probably hide the loading pauses somehow.

== Worlds

Through collection proxies is it thus possible to switch the top level collection, or to load more than one top level collection into the engine. When doing so it is important to know that each top level collection is a separate physical world. Physics interactions (collisions, triggers, ray-casts) happens between objects belonging to the same collection. There is no physics interaction happening between objects belonging to different top level collections.

In the following example we have split the game world into two collections that we dynamically load through collection proxies. The loading and unloading of the two collections is controlled by a game object called "loader" that we put in our main collection "worlds". We configure the game to automatically load the "worlds.collection" file at startup (see link:/doc/game_project[Project settings documentation] for details). The collection "worlds" will hold the "loader" object as well as the GUI elements that allow us to move our character around.

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_worlds_loader.png["Worlds 1", align="center"]

The first collection, "world1", is on the left with purple ground tiles. To the right of the "exit" sign is  the "world2" collection with green ground tiles.

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_worlds_1.png["Worlds 1", align="center"]

Our player character is set up with physics collision against all ground tiles in the level and that allows the player to roll the character on the ground. But let’s see what happens when the player reaches the end of the "world1" collection:

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_worlds_2.png["Worlds 2", align="center"]

The tiles in "world2" have exactly the same collision set up as in "world1", but since the player character game object belongs to "world1", no collision is registered and the character falls through the world.

In games where levels are fully contained within a collection and the player is not expected to seamlessly move between the levels you will never encounter this aspect of collections as separate worlds.

Later we’re going to look deeper into this example and explore how a game can use physics collision and triggers and yet dynamically load pieces of a game world that the player can move between. But first, let’s look at collection proxy basics.

== Editing

To set up a collection proxy you simply add a collection proxy component to a game object. You then name the proxy (give it an id) and tell it which collection file it acts on behalf of:

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_editing.png["Editing", align="center"] 

== Naming collections

Before you start communicating with your collection proxy, you should check the name of each of your collections. Each collection you create in the editor will automatically be assigned the name "default". As long as you’re not dynamically loading that collection through a proxy you can keep that name.

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_name.png["Naming", align="center"] 

However, when you load more than one top level collection through collection proxies, each one must be addressable through the socket part of a URL, and that socket name must be unique:

[source-code]
----
msg.post("world1:manager#script", "remove_player")
msg.post("world2:manager#script", "spawn_player")
----

So a collection you want to load through a proxy should be renamed to a unique name. If you don’t give it a unique name the engine will signal a name collision error:

----
ERROR:GAMEOBJECT: The collection 'default' could not be created since there is already a socket with the same name.
WARNING:RESOURCE: Unable to create resource: build/default/worlds/world1.collectionc
ERROR:GAMESYS: The collection /worlds/world1.collectionc could not be loaded.
----

== Loading

Loading a collection through a proxy is done by sending a message "load" to a proxy component in a game object:

[source-code]
----
-- Tell the proxy "world1" to start loading.
msg.post("loader#world1", "load")
----

The proxy will send back a message "proxy_loaded" when the loading is done. You can then initialize and enable the collection:

[source-code]
----
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
        if message_id == hash("proxy_loaded") then
                -- New world is loaded. Init and enable it.
                msg.post(sender, "init")
                msg.post(sender, "enable")
                ...
----

Alternatively your logic can check the origin of the message an act accordingly. The collection proxy that sent the "proxy_loaded" is indicated in the fragment part of the sender URL:

[source-code]
----
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
        if message_id == hash("proxy_loaded") and sender.fragment == hash("myproxy1") then
                -- "myproxy1" is loaded. Let’s init and enable it.
                ...
----

Initializing the collection through the proxy with the "init" message will recursively initialize all the objects contained in the collection. Enabling the collection through the proxy with the "enable" message recursively enables all the objects contained in the collection.

(See link:/doc/application_lifecycle[Application lifecycle] for details on the lifespan of an object)

Sending "enable" to a loaded proxy will automatically initialize the collection before it is enabled. So if you don’t need fine grained control through the initialization and enable steps you can just do:

[source-code]
----
-- New world is loaded. Init and enable it.
msg.post(sender, "enable")
----

In our platformer example we put a trigger in the "world1" collection at the point where we want to load "world2":

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_trigger.png["Trigger", align="center"] 

We make the trigger part of a "worldswitch" game object that contains the switching logic, to it we tie two properties that allow us to reuse the object. Since the properties are hashes we need to construct URL objects to communicate with the proxies. Note that we want to send our messages to the collection "worlds", where we put our "loader" game object:

[source-code]
----
go.property("selfworld", hash(""))
go.property("otherworld", hash(""))

function init(self)
        -- Construct urls for the proxies. We're gonna use these later.
        self.selfurl = msg.url()
        self.selfurl.socket = "worlds"
        self.selfurl.path = hash("/loader")
        self.selfurl.fragment = self.selfworld
        self.otherurl = msg.url()
        self.otherurl.socket = "worlds"
        self.otherurl.path = hash("/loader")
        self.otherurl.fragment = self.otherworld
end
----

Here’s the setup in the "world2" collection:

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_trigger_2.png["Trigger world 2", align="center"] 

The "exit" sign is placed in the exact same coordinates in both collections giving one tile of overlap between them. Also notice that there is a "player" object in "world2" as well as in "world1". Because each collection is its own physics world we need a separate player in each and we just make sure to transfer the position and input control from one player object to the other when we move between the worlds.

So, when the player hits the trigger in "world1" we start by loading "world2":

[source-code]
----
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
        if message_id == hash("trigger_response") and message.enter then
                -- Player hits the world switch trigger.
                -- Load the next world as referenced through the
                -- previously constructed url.
                msg.post(self.url, "load")
                ...
----
We then enable the collection when it’s loaded:

[source-code]
----
        elseif message_id == hash("proxy_loaded") then
                -- New world is loded. Enable it.
                msg.post(sender, "enable")
----

And then it’s time to switch the player object. We start by sending the current player a message requesting the data we need, which is the current position of the player object:

[source-code]
----
                -- We have to transfer the position of the player 
                -- to the player in the other world.
                local currentsocket = ""
                -- We can't use the hashed properties to build
                -- strings:
                if self.selfworld == hash("world1") then
                        currentsocket = "world1"
                elseif self.selfworld == hash("world2") then
                        currentsocket = "world2"
                end
                msg.post(currentsocket .. ":" .. "/player#script", "request_player")
----

We get a response back and pass the player data to the player in the newly loaded collection:

[source-code]
----
        elseif message_id == hash("player_response") then
                -- We're getting player position back.
                -- Now we have to apply it to the other world's player.
                local othersocket = ""
                if self.otherworld == hash("world1") then
                        othersocket = "world1"
                elseif self.otherworld == hash("world2") then
                        othersocket = "world2"
                end
                -- Pass along the message we got back.
                msg.post(othersocket .. ":" .. "/player#script", "inherit_player", message)
        end
----

The message "inherit_player" just inherits the position sent so the new player is repositioned to the same spot where the old player was (in the trigger, which is fine. It won’t detect the new player since they are parts of two different collections, and physical worlds)

If we run the game we can move from "world1" to "world2", but the player object in "world1" is still present, and will fall through the world of "world2".

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_loading_1.png["Loading 1", align="center"] 

But now we can control the player object of "world2" and roll the character further into the level:

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_loading_2.png["Loading 2", align="center"] 

== Unloading

Now we only have to clean up the world switch a bit. For illustrative purposes we will simply unload the collection we’re leaving. But first, let’s look at how unloading works.

Unloading is handled conversely to loading:

[source-code]
----
msg.post("loader#world1", "disable")
msg.post("loader#world1", "final")
msg.post("loader#world1", "unload")
----

Disabling the collection through the proxy with "disable" sends recursively disables all the objects in the collection. Finalizing the collection through the proxy with a "final" message recursively finalizes all the objects in the collection and "unload" removes the collection from memory.

When the proxy has unloaded the collection it will send back a "proxy_unloaded" message:

[source-code]
----
if message_id == hash("unload_level") then
    local proxy = msg.url("#proxy")
    msg.post(proxy, "disable")
    msg.post(proxy, "final")
    msg.post(proxy, "unload")
elseif message_id == hash("proxy_unloaded") then
    -- Ok, the level is unloaded
    ...
----

If you don’t need the finer grained control, you can send the "unload" message without first disabling and finalizing the collection. The proxy will then automatically disable and finalize the collection before it’s unloaded.

Now back to our platformer example where the only thing we need to do is to send the messages to the right proxy. We do that right after we send the request for data to the new player object:

[source-code]
----
...
msg.post(currentsocket .. ":" .. "/player#script", "request_player")

-- Now it's time to ditch the world we left behind.
-- Normally you wouldn't do this on-screen but we're doing just that
-- to make the whole process clearer and clearly visible.
msg.post(self.selfurl, "disable")
msg.post(self.selfurl, "final")
msg.post(self.selfurl, "unload")
----

And now the collection that is left will unload behind the player:

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_unloading.png["Unloading", align="center"] 

In a real game you wouldn’t want to unload a collection that is still visible on screen. Moreover, you would want to make a smoother player object switch. This simple example just inherits the position of the old player, but the angular and linear velocity is just reset to zero. Depending on your player control you could inherit momentum and animation state of the player object, or you could mask the switch point somehow.

== Input

If you have objects in your loaded collection that require input actions, you need to make sure that the game object that contain the collection proxy acquires input. When the game object receives input messages these are propagated to the components of that object, i.e. the collection proxies. The input actions are sent via the proxy into the loaded collection.

image::images/collection_proxies/collection_proxy_input.png["Input", align="center"] 

If we want to receive input action in objects belonging to either "world1" or "world2", we simply acquire input focus in the script for the "loader" game object:

[source-code]
----
function init(self)
        -- Acquire input so collection objects will receive it.
        msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus")
        ...
----

Any object in either "world1" or "world2" (that is loaded) can now send "acquire_input_focus" and start receiving input actions. (For more information on input, see link:/doc/input[Input])

== Time step

Each collection proxy can individually control the update time step in relation to the application update frequency. You can set the global update frequency in the application project settings (it defaults to 60 frame updates per seconds), or it can be set by sending a message to the +@system+ socket:

[source-code]
----
msg.post("@system:", "set_update_frequency", { frequency = 60 } )
----

Collection proxy updates can be scaled by altering the _time step_. This means that even though the game ticks at a steady 60 FPS, a proxy can update at a higher or lower pace, affecting physics and the "dt" variable passed to +update()+. You can also set the update mode, which allows you to control if the scaling should be performed discretely (which only makes sense with a scale factor below 1.0) or continuously.

You control the scale factor and the scaling mode by sending the proxy a "set_time_step" message:

[source-code]
----
-- update proxy collection at one-fifth-speed.
msg.post("#proxy", "set_time_step", {factor = 0.2, mode = 1}
----

To see what's happening when changing the time step, we can create an object with the following code in a script component and put it in the collection we're altering the timestep of:

[source-code]
----
function update(self, dt)
        print("update() with timestep (dt) " .. dt)
end
----

With a time step of 0.2, we get the following result in the console:

----
INFO:DLIB: SSDP started (ssdp://192.168.0.102:54967, http://0.0.0.0:62162)
INFO:ENGINE: Defold Engine 1.2.37 (6b3ae27)

----

+update()+ is still called 60 times a second, but the "dt" value changes. We see that only 1/5 (0.2) of the calls to +update()+ will have a "dt" of 1/60 (corresponding to 60 FPS) -- the rest is zero. All physics simulations will also be updated according to that dt and advance only in one fifth of the frames.

See link:ref/collection_proxy#set_time_step[set_time_step] for more details.
