Scene Editing
=============

Scene Editor
------------

The Scene Editor is used to edit collections, game objects and some component types.
When it comes to navigating the scene and manipulating objects, it is similar to Maya to use.

Mouse Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

To account for differences in mouse input among different platforms, there is a setting in *File > Preferences > Defold > Scene Editor* called _Mouse Type_.
This setting controls how you interact with the Scene Editor, which is described below.
It defaults to _One Button_ on OS X and _Three Buttons_ for other platforms.

Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~

To navigate in the view, you hold down a mouse button, keyboard modifiers and move the mouse.

* *Tracking* - Alt + Right Button (_Three Button_) or Option + Ctrl + Mouse Button (_One Button_)
* *Dollying* - Alt + Middle Button (_Three Button_) or Ctrl + Mouse Button (_One Button_)

Tracking means moving the camera up, down and sideways.
Dollying means moving the camera forwards or backwards.

To make the camera capture all of the objects, use *Scene > Frame Objects* from the menu.

Object Manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You select objects by clicking on them.
To select many objects, you can either click outside an object and drag to create a selection box.
You can also click them in order while holding down Shift or Ctrl.

By default the Select Tool is active.
In the *Scene* menu you can select other tools for moving and rotating the objects.
Each tool has colored handles, which you can click and drag to manipulate the selected objects.

.Move manipulator, activate with key *W*. Hold down *Shift* to make the objects snap to the grid.
